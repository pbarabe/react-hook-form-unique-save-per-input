# React Hook Form Example - Unique Save/Submit Per Form Input

This example app demonstrates an implementation of a page with multiple form inputs
that each submit separately using the same `onSubmit` function.

## Install and use demo

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/pbarabe/react-hook-form-unique-save-per-input.git
$ cd react-hook-form-unique-save-per-input
$ npm install

```

View the browser's JS console to see `onSubmit` output.
